## 1. Installation

To get started, ensure you have Python (version 3.6 or higher) installed. Next, install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### To Play the Game Using the Keyboard
Run the following Python file to play the Snake game using your keyboard:
```
python snake_origin.py
```

## 2. How to Train

To start training the agent using Deep Q-Learning, run the train.py file:
```
python agent_trainning.py
```
***Note***: You can adjust training parameters (such as the number of episodes, learning rate, etc.) directly in train.py if needed.
## 3. Training Results

You can get the results as shown in the image below:

***Note***: The training results may not be exactly the same, but they should not differ significantly.

## 4. Evaluating the Agent

***To evaluate the performance of the trained agent, run the following Python file:***
```
python run_after_train.py
```

This will show you the agent's performance post-training. The following images depict some of the evaluation results:
